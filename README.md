# Soothing Submarine

## Description
A  three different vanilla javascript particle systems and animated sprite with keyboard and mouse controller systems.  Particles react and move away from the sprite as it moves around the underwater field.  Sprite artwork is original and enspired by a Beattles song. Created as a soothing exercise for folks with dopamine seeking behaviors, such as ADHD, Autism spectrum, etc. Heavily influenced by [Franks Laboratory tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory).<br>
